\section{Introduction}
The building sector accounts for approximately 40\% of final energy consumption and 36\% of greenhouse gas emissions within the European Union. In response, the EU has established ambitious targets under the Horizon 2050 framework to double energy renovation rates over the next decade, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to drive these initiatives forward. The HiDALGO2 project, with its focus on high-performance computing and advanced simulations, is at the forefront of tackling this challenge, particularly through its Urban Building pilot application.

The Urban Building pilot in HiDALGO2 aims to leverage high-performance computing to enhance urban simulations for better energy management and air quality assessment. This section outlines the specific objectives and expected impacts of the project.

Advanced simulation tools are employed to predict energy consumption, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality across both the building and urban scales. These simulations support detailed analysis at the individual building level and extend to broader urban environments, influencing urban planning and policy-making.

Integrating building simulations with urban air pollution models enables the project to assess the environmental impact of building stocks comprehensively. This integration improves the predictive accuracy of the simulations by incorporating real-time data such as wind speed and solar radiation, enhancing the models' responsiveness to environmental conditions.

Implementing these objectives will facilitate more informed urban planning decisions, support policy development for energy efficiency, and contribute to reducing urban greenhouse gas emissions. The project also focuses on enhancing the interaction between different environmental models to provide a holistic view of urban ecosystems.

\section{Overview of Urban Building Modeling and Simulation}

We now provide an overview of the geometrical and physical modeling and simulation components of the Urban building application.

\subsection{Geometry Reconstruction of the Urban Model}

The geometric reconstruction of urban environments within the HiDALGO2 project involves a sophisticated approach to creating multi-fidelity representations of buildings, terrain, vegetation, roads, and other urban elements. This section outlines the methodologies employed and the various levels of detail (LOD) used in the models.

The primary challenge lies in accurately representing the complex urban landscape to support various simulations. A tiled web map approach is adopted, which allows for distributed data management and adapts the Level of Definition (LOD) based on specific needs. However, this approach requires the careful integration of tiles to ensure seamless representation.

We describe our definition of Levels of Detail for Buildings
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LOD-0:} The simplest form, representing buildings as oriented bounding boxes. This level is typically used for large-scale preliminary analyses and quick visual assessments.
    \item \textbf{LOD-1:} Buildings are represented as polygonal extrusions, with added roof structures to improve the visual accuracy and utility in simulations that do not require detailed internal features.
    \item \textbf{LOD-2:} At this level, buildings are detailed using Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standards, supporting detailed thermal and structural analyses. This includes detailed geometries for each entity of the building, often using complex surface models like B-REP, swept solids, or CSG techniques.
\end{itemize}


In the figure~\ref{fig:buildings}, we illustrate the different levels of details.

  \caption{LOD-2 with a zoom}

\end{subfigure}

\label{fig:buildings}
\end{figure}


Building meshes are generated from metadata fetched from web services like OpenStreetMap, which provides multi-polygons with holes, representing the complex urban fabric. For \textbf{LOD-0 and LOD-1}, buildings are modeled from 2D footprints extruded to form three-dimensional volumes. These volumes are then combined or subtracted to represent the district or the entire city, applying union operations on buildings that touch or intersect. In \textbf{LOD-2}, the focus shifts to creating conformal and watertight meshes that are suitable for detailed simulation tasks. These meshes are generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) data in IFC format, enabling a detailed representation of each building component.

In the figure~\ref{fig:city-strasbourg}, we display an illustration of the center of the city of Strasbourg with LOD-0~\ref{fig:city-strasbourg-lod0} and LOD-1\ref{fig:city-strasbourg-lod1} representations.

\subsubsection{Terrain Modeling}
The terrain modeling process utilizes elevation data extracted from raster images. The initial step involves creating a uniform mesh based on the size of the raster image. Following this, the elevation at each node is evaluated. Subsequently, isolines for elevation are computed, and mesh adaptation techniques are applied to reduce mesh density where feasible. Finally, each tile is glued together to ensure the continuity of the terrain mesh.

\subsubsection{Integration of Terrain and Building Meshes}
This process involves creating a conforming mesh that includes both the terrain and the buildings, ensuring that buildings on slopes are accurately modeled by adapting their height and embedding them into the terrain mesh. The figure~\ref{fig:city-grenoble-terrain} illustrates this aspect.

\subsubsection{Visual Representation}
Advanced rendering techniques are employed to visualize the multi-fidelity urban models, supporting both detailed analysis and general urban planning discussions. These visualizations are crucial for assessing the impact of urban changes and for stakeholder engagement.

This approach enhances the accuracy, utility, and scalability of urban models, making them vital for comprehensive urban analysis and planning in the HiDALGO2 project.

\end{subfigure}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Computational Tools for Building Meshes}

In the urban modeling process, particularly in the generation of building meshes, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) plays a pivotal role. CGAL is renowned for its robust and efficient algorithms, which are crucial for handling complex geometric data and generating high-quality meshes from them.

\paragraph{Current Mesh Generation Strategy}
The current strategy for mesh generation employs multi-threading (MT) to handle various stages of the mesh construction process. Initially, the tiles to be used are determined based on the specified location, a task performed sequentially. Following this, GIS data, including buildings and elevation information, is downloaded in parallel. Next, polygons are repaired to ensure they are suitable for mesh generation, with this process executed in parallel using MT. The terrain mesh is then generated in parallel, employing CGAL's algorithms to ensure precision and efficiency. Union operations at tile junctions are performed to ensure continuity, a step that is currently sequential. Finally, building meshes are generated using a parallel MT approach, leveraging CGAL for its advanced mesh generation capabilities.

\paragraph{Advancing Towards Full Parallelism}
The next steps in enhancing the mesh generation process involve moving towards a fully parallel approach using both Multi-threading (MT) and Message Passing Interface (MPI). The goal is to scale the process up to handle entire cities or larger urban areas. This scale-up involves utilizing MPI to manage distributed computing resources effectively. To achieve this, partitions of tiles with overlapping areas are created to ensure complete and accurate building descriptions without the need for extensive MPI communication. Furthermore, each process uses an MT strategy to generate meshes independently, with overlapping zones allowing for the creation of complete building structures.

\subsubsection{Partitioning Strategies Depending on Simulation Use Cases}
Different partitioning strategies are employed depending on the specific requirements of the simulation use cases. For simple scenarios where buildings do not interact with their environment, a basic listing and weighting strategy is sufficient, known as Test Case 0. In Test Case 1, where buildings interact with environmental elements, a more complex partitioning strategy is necessary that considers both the buildings and their immediate non-building surroundings. For full interaction models, as in Test Case 2, the partitioning strategy starts with the buildings and extends to the entire urban mesh, ensuring that all elements are considered to minimize communication overhead. Looking towards scenarios with extreme partitioning needs, Test Case 3 employs a multigrid approach, defining coarse and fine meshes to efficiently manage computational resources. This multi-fidelity approach not only enhances the accuracy and applicability of urban models in simulations but also ensures scalability across different computational platforms, making it a cornerstone of urban analysis in the HiDALGO2 project.

The figure~\ref{fig:partitioning} illustrate the different strategies discussed previously and present a reconstruction of New York with 10km square reconstruction with hundreds of thousands of buildings which requires the large scale approach discussed but not yet implemented nor tested.

\subsection{Modeling and simulations}

We now turn to describing the physical modeling of  city energy simulation.
To do this we build on two main tools: Feel++ and Modelica. 

\subsubsection{Feel++ Toolchain}

Feel++ is a comprehensive framework designed to tackle problems based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Utilizing modern C++ (C++17 and C++20) standards coupled with a Python layer through Pybind11, Feel++ enables seamless parallelism and is equipped with default communicators that simplify the handling of complex computational tasks.

This powerful toolchain is essential for the Urban Building pilot of the HiDALGO

\subsubsection{Computing Shading Masks and View Factors with Feel++}

In urban building energy simulations, the computation of shading masks and view factors is crucial for accurately modeling the impact of solar radiation on building surfaces. Shading masks quantify the percentage of blocked solar radiation for each building surface (including walls and roofs) depending on the direction of the sun. This is influenced by nearby structures such as other buildings, vegetation, and urban furniture. The view factors describe the fraction of radiation that leaves one surface and strikes another, which are essential for calculating radiative heat exchanges between building surfaces.

\paragraph{Numerical Methods and Challenges}
Both shading masks and view factors are computed using Monte Carlo and ray tracing techniques, which allow for handling complex geometries with various obstructions. Despite being purely geometric quantities, these calculations face significant challenges such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Efficient computation of integrals for view factors, especially when considering specular surfaces that require multiple ray bounces.
    \item Managing large-scale mesh computations and data storage, particularly when detailed urban environments are modeled.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Implementation in Feel++}
Feel++ facilitates these computations through its robust numerical methods optimized for high performance and parallel execution. For each face of a building, Feel++ computes solar masks using a Monte Carlo approach for various sun positions, ensuring efficient and scalable processing across multiple CPU cores. This enables the integration of dynamic solar shading effects into the simulation of building energy performance, providing a more accurate representation of real-world conditions.

\subsubsection{Heat Transfer Modeling with Feel++ and Modelica}
In the Urban Building Energy Model (UBEM), heat transfer analysis is a crucial component for predicting energy consumption, internal air temperature variations, and overall building energy performance. This analysis is facilitated by a combination of Feel++ and Modelica, which together enable detailed simulations of heat dynamics within urban buildings.

\paragraph{Modelica for Multizone Heat Transfer}
Modelica offers extensive capabilities for multizone building energy simulations, utilizing models that range from simple (LOD-0) to more complex (LOD-1) representations. The multizone approach in Modelica is particularly useful for modular and scalable simulations, where each zone of the building can be modeled with different fidelity based on the simulation requirements. This method leverages the generation of Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) which integrate seamlessly into larger C/C++ applications, providing a robust framework for handling complex simulations involving multiple interacting systems.

\paragraph{Finite Element Analysis with Feel++}
Complementing Modelica's capabilities, Feel++ provides robust tools for finite element analysis, particularly in handling the detailed aspects of heat transfer within urban environments. It uses advanced numerical methods like reduced basis methods for rapid scenario testing and parallel-in-time algorithms for efficient simulations. This is particularly important for assessing the impact of solar radiation and external shading, which are modeled using both geometric and dynamic shading masks derived from solar paths.

\paragraph{Integrated Approach}
The integration of Feel++ and Modelica is exemplified in their use of shading masks and view factors, critical for accurate solar heat gain calculations. These masks are computed using Monte Carlo simulations and ray tracing methods to assess the percentage of solar radiation impacting various building surfaces. This data feeds into the Modelica simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the thermal load predictions.

\paragraph{Challenges and Solutions}
One of the main challenges in urban building simulation is managing the computational load, which is addressed through hybrid computing strategies that leverage both CPUs and GPUs. This approach ensures that large-scale simulations, necessary for city-wide energy analysis, remain feasible and efficient. Additionally, the mesh partitioning techniques discussed earlier are employed to optimize the data handling and processing times, further integrating the spatial data management with the thermal modeling processes.

By utilizing the combined strengths of Feel++ for detailed finite element analysis and Modelica for system-level energy simulation, the UBEM framework achieves a comprehensive tool capable of addressing the complex dynamics of urban heat transfer and energy management.

\subsection{HPC Benchmarking CI/CD}
The benchmarking CI/CD pipeline is triggered upon successful completion of the standard CI/CD processes, which include automated testing and validation of the software. New Apptainer containers are created and made available, facilitating deployment on diverse computational resources.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Automated Testing:} Once new changes are integrated and the standard CI/CD pipeline succeeds, larger scale tests are automatically initiated on a designated HPC node with significant computational resources, for example, 128 cores.
    \item \textbf{Manual and Scheduled Testing:} For extensive validation, tests can also be manually triggered or scheduled to run at predefined intervals. This flexibility allows for comprehensive performance assessments under varying loads and configurations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use of Reframe}
Reframe is employed as the regression testing framework, essential for verifying the stability and performance regressions of the software across updates. It enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Systematic execution of test suites across different HPC systems.
    \item Collection and analysis of performance data to monitor software behavior and performance trends over time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with HPC Systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{EuroHPC Integration:} The Urban Building pilot is integrated with several EuroHPC systems like LUMI, Karolina, Meluxina, and Discoverer, enhancing the capability to perform simulations at an unprecedented scale.
    \item \textbf{Local and International HPC Systems:} The framework also supports deployment on local HPC systems (e.g., Gaya) and international platforms like PSNC's Eagle, ensuring wide accessibility and usability of the software.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monitoring and Reporting}
All performance results are automatically captured and uploaded to the HiDALGO2 portal. This ensures that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stakeholders have real-time access to performance reports.
    \item Decision-makers can review comprehensive data to guide further optimization and development efforts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment and Scalability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Containerized Deployment:} Utilizing Docker and Apptainer containers ensures that the Urban Building application is portable and consistent across various computing environments.
    \item \textbf{Scalable Benchmarking:} The capability to scale tests according to the available hardware and project requirements is critical, allowing the team to simulate urban environments of varying complexities.
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive HPC operations framework underlines the commitment of the HiDALGO2 project to leveraging cutting-edge computational technologies to enhance urban simulation studies, ensuring high performance and accuracy of the Urban Building models.
