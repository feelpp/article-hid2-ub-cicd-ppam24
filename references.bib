	abstract = {🎉  We're happy to share our developments as we approach the V111 release of Feel++. Following a refreshed naming strategy, we've moved to the -preview.x suffix from the conventional -alpha.x, -beta, or -rc labels. This change signifies our dedication to enhancing transparency and setting clear expectations for our pre-release versions.

Each pre-release version of Feel++ undergoes a rigorous process, encompassing detailed reviews, extensive tests across varied scenarios, and careful packaging. Our commitment to delivering a high-quality, reliable experience is reflected in our comprehensive platform support strategy. Alongside offering support for the latest two Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Ubuntu and the newest LTS version of Debian, we're excited to announce that Feel++ is now accessible to Windows users through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and to Mac users via MacPorts, Homebrew, and Docker. This expansion of platform support is a testament to our commitment to making Feel++ as accessible and versatile as possible for our diverse user base.

As we continue to refine and enhance Feel++, the V111 release promises to bring forward significant innovations and improvements. Stay tuned for further updates of Feel++.

	abstract = {Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.},

	abstract = {Errors in biomechanical simulations arise from modelling and discretization. Discretization errors can be quantified with a posteriori error estimates. The relevance of such error estimates for practical biomechanics problems is rarely adressed. In this contribution, we propose an implementation of a posteriori error estimates targeting a user-defined quantity of interest, with the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) technique tailored to biomechanics. We consider a general setting that encompasses three-dimensional geometries as well as model non-linearities, appearing in hyperelastic soft tissues. We take advantage of the capabilities of automatic differentiation embedded into modern finite element software, that allows to compute the error estimates generically for a large class of models and constitutive laws. First we validate our methodology using experimental measurements from silicone samples, and then illustrate its applicability for patient-specific computations of pressure ulcers on a human heel.},

The mathematical description and the numerical schemes are designed in such a way that general constitutive relations (which are realistic for biomechanics applications) for the ﬂuid as well as for the structural part can be easily incorporated. We utilize the LBB-stable ﬁnite element pairs Q2P1 and P2+P1 for discretization in space to gain high accuracy and perform as time-stepping the 2nd order Crank-Nicholson, respectively, a new modiﬁed Fractional-Step-θ -scheme for both solid and ﬂuid parts. The resulting discretized nonlinear algebraic system is solved by a Newton method which approximates the Jacobian matrices by a divided differences approach, and the resulting linear systems are solved by direct or iterative solvers, preferably of Krylov-multigrid type.},

While the standard strong-constraint 4DVar approach uses the given observational data to estimate only the unknown initial condition of the model, the weak-constraint 4D-Var formulation additionally provides an estimate for the model error and thus can deal with imperfect models. Since the model error is a distributed function in both space and time, the 4D-Var formulation leads to a large-scale optimization problem for every given parameter instance of the PDE model. To solve the problem eﬃciently, various reduced order approaches have therefore been proposed in the recent past. Here, we employ the reduced basis method to generate reduced order approximations for the state, adjoint, initial condition, and model error.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear model order reduction has opened the door to parameter optimization and uncertainty quantification in complex physics problems governed by nonlinear equations. In particular, the computational cost of solving these equations can be reduced by means of local reduced-order bases. This article examines the benefits of a physics-informed cluster analysis for the construction of cluster-specific reduced-order bases. We illustrate that the choice of the dissimilarity measure for clustering is fundamental and highly affects the performances of the local reduced-order bases. It is shown that clustering with an angle-based dissimilarity on simulation data efficiently decreases the intra-cluster Kolmogorov \$N\$-width. Additionally, an a priori efficiency criterion is introduced to assess the relevance of a ROM-net, a methodology for the reduction of nonlinear physics problems introduced in our previous work in [T. Daniel, F. Casenave, N. Akkari, D. Ryckelynck, Model order reduction assisted by deep neural networks (ROM-net), Advanced Modeling and Simulation in Engineering Sciences 7 (16), 2020]. This criterion also provides engineers with a very practical method for ROM-nets' hyperparameters calibration under constrained computational costs for the training phase. On five different physics problems, our physics-informed clustering strategy significantly outperforms classic strategies for the construction of local reduced-order bases in terms of projection errors.},

	abstract = {Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a recently introduced technique that employs the Computer Aided Design (CAD) concept of Non-uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) tool to bridge the substantial bottleneck between the CAD and  nite element analysis (FEA)  elds. The simpli ed transition of exact CAD models into the analysis alleviates the issues originating from geometrical discontinuities and thus, signi cantly reduces the design-to-analysis time in comparison to traditional FEA technique. Since its origination, the research in the  eld of IGA is accelerating and has been applied to various problems. However, the employment of CAD tools in the area of FEA invokes the need of adapting the existing implementation procedure for the framework of IGA. Also, the usage of IGA requires the in-depth knowledge of both the CAD and FEA  elds. This can be overwhelming for a beginner in IGA. Hence, in this paper, a simpli ed introduction and implementation details for the incorporation of Non-uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) based IGA technique within the existing FEA code is presented. It is shown that with little modi cations, the available standard code structure of FEA can be adapted for IGA. For the clear and concise explanation of these modi cations, step-by-step implementation of a benchmark plate with a circular hole under the action of in-plane tension is included.},

Results of Rayleigh–Bénard convection ﬂow are also presented and validated with literature data. Finally, the proposed coupled formulation between HDG and CG for heat equation is combined with the coupled Navier–Stokes/convection diffusion equations to formulate a new CG–HDG model for solving conjugate heat transfer problems. Benchmark examples are solved using the proposed model and validated with literature values. The proposed CG–HDG model is also compared with a CG–CG model, where all the equations are discretized using the CG method, and it is concluded that CG–HDG model can have a superior computational efﬁciency when compared to CG–CG model.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the behavior of flows over a backward-facing step geometry for various expansion ratios H/h=1.9423, 2.5 and 3.0. A literature survey was carried out and it was found that the flow shows a strong two-dimensional behavior, on the plane of symmetry, for Reynolds numbers ReD=ρUbD/μ below approximately 400 (Ub=bulk velocity and D=hydraulic diameter). In this Reynolds number range, two-dimensional predictions were carried out to provide information on the general integral properties of backward-facing step flows, on mean velocity distributions and streamlines. Information on characteristic flow patterns is provided for a wide Reynolds number range, 10−4⩽ReD⩽800. In the limiting case of ReD→0, a sequence of Moffatt eddies of decreasing size and intensity is verified to exist in the concave corner also at ReD=1. The irreversible pressure losses are determined for various Reynolds numbers as a function of the expansion ratio. The two-dimensional simulations are known to underpredict the primary reattachment length for Reynolds numbers beyond which the actual flow is observed to be three-dimensional. The spatial evolution of jet-like flows in both the streamwise and the spanwise direction and transition to three-dimensionality were studied at a Reynolds number ReD=648. This three-dimensional analysis with the same geometry and flow conditions as reported by Armaly et al. (1983) reveals the formation of wall jets at the side wall within the separating shear layer. The wall jets formed by the spanwise component of the velocity move towards the symmetry plane of the channel. A self-similar wall-jet profile emerges at different spanwise locations starting with the vicinity of the side wall. These results complement information on backward-facing step flows that is available in the literature.},

We show analytically that (i) the diﬀerence between the two nonlinearities is governed by the diﬀerence in the resolution of the Bernoulli and kinematic pressures, and (ii) a simple, linear grad-div stabilization ameliorates much of the bad scaling of the error with respect to Re. We also give experiments that show bad velocity approximation is tied to poor pressure resolution in either form.},

Since its introduction, the EMAC formulation has been successfully used for a wide variety of fluid dynamics problems. We prove that discretizations using the EMAC formulation are potentially better than those built on the commonly used skew-symmetric formulation, by deriving a better longer time error estimate for EMAC: while the classical results for schemes using the skew-symmetric formulation have Gronwall constants dependent on exp(C · Re · T ) with Re the Reynolds number, it turns out that the EMAC error estimate is free from this explicit exponential dependence on the Reynolds number. Additionally, it is demonstrated how EMAC admits smaller lower bounds on its velocity error, since incorrect treatment of linear momentum, angular momentum and energy induces lower bounds for L2 velocity error, and EMAC treats these quantities more accurately. Results of numerical tests for channel flow past a cylinder and 2D Kelvin–Helmholtz instability are also given, both of which show that the advantages of EMAC over the skew-symmetric formulation increase as the Reynolds number gets larger and for longer simulation times.},

	abstract = {The kinetic energy of a flow is proportional to the square of the L2(Ω ) norm of the velocity. Given a sufficient regular velocity field and a velocity finite element space with polynomials of degree r , then the best approximation error in L2(Ω ) is of order r + 1. In this survey, the available finite element error analysis for the velocity error in L∞(0, T ; L2(Ω )) is reviewed, where T is a final time. Since in practice the case of small viscosity coefficients or dominant convection is of particular interest, which may result in turbulent flows, robust error estimates are considered, i.e., estimates where the constant in the error bound does not depend on inverse powers of the viscosity coefficient. Methods for which robust estimates can be derived enable stable flow simulations for small viscosity coefficients on comparatively coarse grids, which is often the situation encountered in practice. To introduce stabilization techniques for the convection-dominated regime and tools used in the error analysis, evolutionary linear convection–diffusion equations are studied at the beginning. The main part of this survey considers robust finite element methods for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations of order r − 1, r , and r + 1/2 for the velocity error in L∞(0, T ; L2(Ω )). All these methods are discussed in detail. In particular, a sketch of the proof for the error bound is given that explains the estimate of important terms which determine finally the order of convergence. Among them, there are methods for inf–sup stable pairs of finite element spaces as well as for pressure-stabilized discretizations. Numerical studies support the analytic results for several of these methods. In addition, methods are surveyed that behave in a robust way but for which only a non-robust error analysis is available. The conclusion of this survey is that the problem of whether or not there is a robust method with optimal convergence order for the kinetic energy is still open.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the recently introduced EMAC formulation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which is the only known NS formulation that conserves energy, momentum and angular momentum when the divergence constraint is only weakly enforced. Since its introduction, the EMAC formulation has been successfully used for a wide variety of ﬂuid dynamics problems. We prove that discretizations using the EMAC formulation are potentially better than those built on the commonly used skew-symmetric formulation, by deriving a better longer time error estimate for EMAC: while the classical results for schemes using the skew-symmetric formulation have Gronwall constants dependent on exp(C · Re · T ) with Re the Reynolds number, it turns out that the EMAC error estimate is free from this explicit exponential dependence on the Reynolds number. Additionally, it is demonstrated how EMAC admits smaller lower bounds on its velocity error, since incorrect treatment of linear momentum, angular momentum and energy induces lower bounds for L2 velocity error, and EMAC treats these quantities more accurately. Results of numerical tests for channel ﬂow past a cylinder and 2D Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are also given, both of which show that the advantages of EMAC over the skew-symmetric formulation increase as the Reynolds number gets larger and for longer simulation times.},

MATLAB oﬀers a set of open source adaptive step functions for solving ODEs. One of these functions is the ode15s recommended to solve stiﬀ problems and which is based on the Backward Diﬀerentiation Formulae (BDF). We describe the error estimation and the step size control implemented in this function. The ode15s is a variable order algorithm, and even though it has an adaptive step size implementation, the advancing formula and the local error estimation that uses correspond to the constant step size formula. We have focused on the second order accurate and unconditionally stable BDF (BDF2) and we have implemented a real adaptive step size BDF2 algorithm using the same strategy as the BDF2 implemented in the ode15s, resulting the new algorithm more eﬃcient than the one implemented in MATLAB.},

However, VSVO methods have limited impact in timestepping methods in complex applications due to their computational complexity and the diﬃculty to implement them in legacy code. We introduce a family of implicit, embedded, VSVO methods that require only one BDF solve at each time step followed by adding linear combinations of the solution at previous time levels. In particular, we construct implicit and linearly implicit VSVO methods of orders two, three and four with the same computational complexity as variable stepsize BDF3. The choice of changing the order of the method is simple and does not require additional solves of linear or nonlinear systems.},

	abstract = {Heat and mass transport processes in humans occur at cellular, tissue, organ, and whole-body levels. The subﬁeld of heat and mass transfer in the human eye provides the context for understanding the functions of the eye and to develop protective, diagnostic, and therapeutic processes. The eye is sensitive to the environment because of the absence of blood ﬂow through parts such as cornea and lens, and the absence of thermal sensors and protective reﬂexes beyond blinking. Heat transfer processes in the eye comprise the continuous evaporation of the tear layer coating the corneal region of a normal eye, the thermal massage across the pupils called the transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), and the several methods of internal tissue ablation involving lasers. Drug delivery inside the eye is an important man-made mass transfer process that includes the intravitreous and transscleral routes to medicate the retina. This chapter focuses on the exposition of heat transfer processes that drive laser surgical methods and the mass transfer processes that govern drug delivery methods to the retina. In a bridging section, discussion on the combined heat and mass transfer processes involved in the TTT-based convection-assisted drug diffusion to the retina through the vitreous humor is also provided.},

	abstract = {There are a lot of geometrical and morphological changes that happen in the human eye with age. Primary openangle glaucoma, which is caused by the increase in intraocular pressure inside the anterior chamber of the eye is also associated with the physiological aging of the eye. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effects of aging on drug delivery in the human eye when applied topically. Consequently, a numerical model of topical drug delivery for an aging human eye has been developed using commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics in the current study. Three different age groups (young, middle and old) have been considered and the changes in geometrical and tissue properties of different domains of the eye with age have been included in the numerical model. The effect of aging on heat transfer, aqueous humor flow, intraocular pressure and drug concentration in different domains and orientations of the eye have been investigated. Additionally, an attempt has been made to predict the best class of anti-glaucomatic treatment in silico that should be preferred to treat primary open-angle glaucoma effectively. Results illustrate that there is a decrease in the average corneal temperature and an in­ crease in the temperature deviation across the cornea with age. Further, there is a decrease in the aqueous humor flow magnitude in the anterior chamber of the eye and an increase in intraocular pressure in the anterior chamber of older age groups, which leads to primary open-angle glaucoma. The reduced aqueous humor flow leads to increased drug concentration in the anterior chamber as well as iris and reduced drug concentration in the trabecular mesh of the older age groups, thereby affecting the treatment efficacy. Additionally, our simulated results demonstrate that anti-glaucomatic treatments should be more focused on treating the trabecular mesh rather than the ciliary body of the eye.},

The obtained results provide a link between the known scenario of a homogeneous disk and that, well known, of a sphere. The scenario of the flat spheroid of aspect ratio 10 has many common features with that of an infinitely thin disk, but the finite thickness brings about significant quantitative differences. At the opposite side of the investigated aspect ratio interval, the dynamics of the spheroid of aspect ratio 1.1 is found very close to that of a perfect sphere except for small density ratios (smaller than approximately 0.5). Very light spheroids of aspect ratio 1.1 move along vertical zig-zagging trajectories. At intermediate aspect ratios, the strong subcritical effects and the characteristic zig-zagging and fluttering motion, typical for flat bodies, progressively disappear. The tumbling regime remains remarkably stable and is shown to be present down to

              . An interesting result consists in the evidence of the first two bifurcations typical for the sphere scenario (leading to steady oblique and oblique oscillating trajectories) present both for very flat and thick spheroids but absent at intermediate aspect ratios. The results pertaining to spheroids might be more useful in practical applications than those obtained for too idealized thin disks and perfect spheres.},
